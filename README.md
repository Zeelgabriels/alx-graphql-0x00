# GraphQL Character Queries - Task 0

## Objective
Write GraphQL queries to retrieve specific character information using their IDs from the Rick and Morty API.

## API Endpoint
- **GraphQL Endpoint**: https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql

## Task Description
This task involves creating GraphQL queries to fetch character details for IDs 1, 2, 3, and 4. Each query retrieves the following fields:
- `id` - Character's unique identifier
- `name` - Character's name  
- `status` - Character's current status (Alive, Dead, Unknown)
- `species` - Character's species (Human, Alien, etc.)
- `type` - Character's subspecies or specific type
- `gender` - Character's gender

## Files Structure
- `character-id-1.graphql` / `character-id-1-output.json` - Rick Sanchez
- `character-id-2.graphql` / `character-id-2-output.json` - Morty Smith  
- `character-id-3.graphql` / `character-id-3-output.json` - Summer Smith
- `character-id-4.graphql` / `character-id-4-output.json` - Beth Smith

## Query Pattern
All queries follow the same structure, only changing the ID parameter:

```graphql
query {
  character(id: [ID_NUMBER]) {
    id
    name
    status
    species
    type
    gender
  }
}
```

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding GraphQL query syntax
- Using arguments in GraphQL queries  
- Requesting specific fields to avoid over-fetching
- Working with the Rick and Morty GraphQL API

# GraphQL Character Pagination Queries - Task 1

## Objective
Create GraphQL queries to retrieve paginated lists of characters from the Rick and Morty API, demonstrating how to handle multiple records and pagination patterns.
Key Concepts Learned

Pagination: Splitting large datasets into manageable pages (20 characters per page)
Plural vs Singular Queries: characters(page: Int) vs character(id: ID!)
Results Wrapper: Multiple records are returned within a results array
Field Selection: Requesting only necessary fields (id, name, status, image)

## Query Pattern for Pagination
graphqlquery {
  characters(page: [PAGE_NUMBER]) {
    results {
      id
      name
      status
      image
    }
  }
}

## Files Added (Task 1)

characters-page-1.graphql / characters-page-1-output.json - Characters 1-20
characters-page-2.graphql / characters-page-2-output.json - Characters 21-40
characters-page-3.graphql / characters-page-3-output.json - Characters 41-60
characters-page-4.graphql / characters-page-4-output.json - Characters 61-80

## Response Structure Difference
### Task 0 (Single Character):
json{
  "data": {
    "character": {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "Rick Sanchez"
    }
  }
}
### Task 1 (Multiple Characters):
json{
  "data": {
    "characters": {
      "results": [
        {
          "id": "1", 
          "name": "Rick Sanchez"
        },
        {
          "id": "2",
          "name": "Morty Smith"
        }
        // ... 18 more characters
      ]
    }
  }
}

## Learning Outcomes

Understanding pagination in GraphQL APIs
Working with array responses (results)
Recognizing patterns in query structure
Efficient data fetching for large datasets
Difference between singular and plural GraphQL operations


## Episode Queries - Task 2

### Objective
Write GraphQL queries to fetch episode details using pagination from the Rick and Morty API.
Key Learning Points

Episode Data Structure: Episodes contain id, name, air_date, and episode fields
Episode Pagination: Similar to character pagination, episodes are returned in pages
Cross-Domain Queries: Applied pagination concepts from characters to episodes
Episode Codes: Episodes use format like "S01E01" (Season 1, Episode 1)

### Query Pattern
graphqlquery {
  episodes(page: [PAGE_NUMBER]) {
    results {
      id
      name
      air_date
      episode
    }
  }
}

### Files Structure (Task 2)

episode-page-1.graphql with characters-page-1-output.json
characters-page-2.graphql with characters-page-2-output.json
characters-page-3.graphql with characters-page-3-output.json
characters-page-4.graphql with characters-page-4-output.json

### Note: File naming follows task requirements exactly as specified.
Episode Data Example
Episodes typically contain information like:

name: "Pilot" or "Lawnmower Dog"
air_date: "December 2, 2013"
episode: "S01E01" (Season/Episode code)

### Learning Outcome
Successfully demonstrated ability to apply GraphQL pagination patterns across different data types (characters â†’ episodes).
